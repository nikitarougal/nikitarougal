### Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸ‘‹

I have experience in both Salesforce and web development, having worked with various technologies and platforms to deliver effective solutions.

As a Salesforce Developer, I have a strong background in developing applications using Lightning Components (LWC and Aura), Visualforce, Apex, APIs, Web Services, and Triggers. I am experienced in handling security policies, SSO configuration, sharing rules, permissions, and roles, as well as utilizing Process Builder, Flows, SQL/SOQL/SOSL, and creating custom integrations. In addition to development, I have provided technical assistance to internal and external customers, successfully identifying, investigating, and resolving various technical issues, including performance optimization and configuration challenges.

Moreover, I also have a background in web development, where I have worked on improving website functionality and optimizing speed and performance as a Web Developer.

In terms of qualifications, I hold several Salesforce certifications, including Salesforce Platform Developer (I & II), Admin, Platform App Builder, and JavaScript. These certifications validate my technical skills and dedication to staying up-to-date with the latest industry standards.

Throughout my professional experiences, I have honed my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and collaboration skills. I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to deliver innovative solutions that drive business success.

To ensure efficient release management, I have hands-on experience with standard platforms such as Git, Jenkins, and BitBucket. These platforms have allowed me to effectively manage version control and streamline the release process.

I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of technology and contributing to impactful projects. Thank you for considering my background and experience.
